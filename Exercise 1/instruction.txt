CMSC 132 Lab Exercise 1

Make a program that will read in and accept the different files:

a. text file
b. audio file
c. video file

Retrieve the running time as well as the CPU time used in reading in the different files. Compare their
respective running time and CPU time when executed on a different machine.

After you have made the exercise, answer the following questions:

1. Does file size make a significant difference in determining CPU time? How so?
2. What do you think are the computer resources (software & hardware) that are being utilized when
executing the program you have made?
3. Was there a significant difference in running time and CPU time when the program was executed
on a different machine?
4. What are the factors that affects the CPU time?

MainClass File:


1. Yes, the file size makes a significant difference in determining CPU time. The more bytes the CPU is 
processing, then the more time it would take to read each set of bytes.
2. IDE, processor
